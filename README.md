# ZeroSeven.WeatherService.API
Author: Gerard Patea

Intended for the guys at ZeroSeven to demonstrate the ability to:
  1. Call ZeroSeven's GetNextDayTrip API
  2. Using the response from 1. to then call the WillyWeather API (https://www.willyweather.com.au/api/docs/index.html)
  3. The response from 2. is then used to do a POST against ZeroSeven's TellMeTheWeather API
  4. Then the response from 3. is used to display on a simple web site

The web app is in Angular and is a simple shell which basically has a Start button on it and displays the resulting message.
